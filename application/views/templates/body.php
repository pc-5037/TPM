			<h2>Wireless sensor-based application for managing Theme Park</h2>
                        <p>Wireless sensor-based application for managing theme park is a web application 
                            for accumulating and displaying data that were collected from the guests via 
                            environmental sensors e.g. temperature sensor, accelerometer sensor, pulse sensor
                            , and RFID technology with the help of Arduino microcontroller. To provide a 
                            report on visiting statistics and a unique selling-point, sensors, Wi-Fi module 
                            and RFID reader will be attached to the arduino in order to collect data from 
                            theme park's guest, then sent them to web server, which the data will be handled 
                            and displayed.</p>
